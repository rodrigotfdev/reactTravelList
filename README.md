# About This Project


## Project Main Idea

This project was built using React + Vite. The main goal was to create an application with a dynamic travel list that, upon receiving user information through a form, adds these received details to the travel list.

🔨 Project Functionalities

* Sort the items in the list by entry order, description, and status.

* A button that, with just one click, clears all the items on the list, restoring it to its initial state.

* A status bar displaying how many items have been added to the list and how many have been packed.


## Key concepts of JavaScript and React used

✔️ State Management and Lifiting State Up

✔️ Child-to-Parent Communication

✔️ Derived State

✔️ Array manipulation methods such as Map, Filter, Reduce, Sort, Slice
